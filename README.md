# Stuart P. Bentley's Household Items

These are some basic one-off items I've thrown together in SCAD

## ac-window-holder

This is a small clip I designed to keep a sheet of plexiglass attached
to my apartment's window screen, for use with an air conditioner hose.

## belkin-power-strip-switch cap

This is a simple cap for the Belkin power strip I keep my desktop (and
accessories) plugged into, to stop the power switch from being
inadvertently turned off.

One nice feature about this is the parameters of the model being
marked on the surface of the model, so different iterations could be
easily identified and reproduced based on the independent parameters
being experimented with.

## blinds-clip

This is a replacement for clips on the window blinds in my apartment
that have broken.

## futon

These are a few pieces for my futon.

The "futon-spacer" was designed to keep the legs of the futon away from
the moulding of the wall, and has never actually been printed (I ended
up using some suitably-sized blocks of styrofoam instead).

## kitchenware

Currently, this contains a draft "cream cheese puller", for pinching
tubes of cream cheese.

## roll-cart

These are a few pieces to fix a caddy I bought about a decade ago whose
wheels broke: a bearing to fit some more robust wheels I bought at a
hardware store onto the small axle of the caddy, and a cap to keep the
wheels on the axle.

## signs

This contains a sign I made to remind me that our apartment windows
face the street.

## tiny-washers

This was a trivial experiment to try printing tiny little plastic rings
for some tongs I was holding together with Nylock nuts
